            <b>Background:</b> Proteins are frequently affected by mutations with consequences on 
            their structure’s stability, functionality, and binding affinity towards ligands, 
            with important biological effects. Molecular Dynamics Simulation (MDS) is one of 
            the most effective tools to in silico predict the binding affinity changes upon 
            aminoacidic mutations. A fundamental requirement to conduct this analysis is the 
            availability of the three-dimensional structures of the wild-type (wt) and mutated 
            protein isoforms. Until now, crystallographic models have been mostly used. Recently, 
            with the development of AlphaFold2, protein structure predictions with high model 
            accuracy are possible. In this study, an automated computational workflow to compute 
            the difference in the binding free energy between the wt and the mutated protein using 
            AlphaFold2 is proposed. The workflow consists of generating the AlphaFold models for 
            the wt and mutated proteins and studying their interaction with ligands using MDS to 
            calculate the difference in binding free energy and infer the mutation effect on binding 
            affinity. To evaluate the workflow confidence, two accuracy predictors are proposed: 
            the distance between computed affinities of mutant and wt proteins 
            (i.e. &Delta;&Delta;G = |&Delta; G <sub>mutant</sub> - &Delta; G<sub>wt</sub>|), and an accuracy 
            evaluation of the wt proteins models predicted with AlphaFold2 based on the analysis 
            of side chains orientation. <br>
            <b>Results: </b>We observed how AlphaFold’s models coupled with MDS can be used in 
            binding affinity measurements with an accuracy comparable to that obtained by using 
            crystallographic structures. The workflow is validated through results obtained by using 
            crystallographic structures on a benchmark constituted by proteins in complexes with 
            small ligands, cofactors, and ions, with a high variability of applications. The side chains 
            orientation parameter has been identified as an important workflow confidence 
            estimator because, even though the high accuracy of AlphaFold2 predictions, side 
            chains orientation in predicted wt proteins can significantly differ from the 
            crystallographic models, with considerable effects on binding affinity calculations. <br>
            <b>Conclusion:</b> The proposed automated computational workflow successfully integrates 
            AlphaFold2 with MDS for in silico predicting protein-ligand binding affinity. Thus, 
            AlphaFold’s models can be beneficial in studying the effect of mutations on binding 
            affinity even for proteins with unavailable crystallographic structures.
