                Proteins are frequently affected by mutations with consequences on their structureâ€™s stability, 
                functionality, and binding affinity towards ligands, with important biological effects. 
                Molecular Dynamics Simulation (MDS) is an effective tool for predicting <i>in silico</i>
                the binding affinity changes upon aminoacidic mutations. 
                An essential element for this analysis is the availability of the three-dimensional 
                structures of the wild-type (wt) and mutated protein isoforms. Until now, crystallographic 
                structures have been mostly used. Recently, AlphaFold2 allows protein structure predictions 
                to be made with high model accuracy. In this study, a computational workflow to compute the 
                difference in the binding free energy between the wt and the mutated protein using AlphaFold2 
                is proposed. The workflow consists in generating the AlphaFold models for the wt and mutated 
                proteins, and studying their interaction with ligands using MDS in order to calculate the 
                difference in binding free energy and infer the mutation effect on binding affinity. 
                The workflow is validated through results obtained by using crystallographic structures on a 
                benchmark constistued by 15 mutant proteins.
